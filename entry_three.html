        <h3>Immense feelings of dread and sorrow</h3>
        
        <p><ul>
            <li>I am feeling a great feeling of dread.. I am on the verge of a mental breakdown and potential attempt on my own life. I feel like the world does not care </br>for my feelings and whenever I bring something up to someone its always "My Fault".. It seems that it doesn't matter how hard I push myself to be better and not fold to the pressure like they had.</br> The closer.. and more comfy death seems, I am not sure if I will be okay after today.. I just don't wanna be here anymore, the pain is too much and the knowledge that even my own mother tells me this is my fault.. hurts to my core.. I want to die..</br> <h2>If I don't update this anymore.. I am sorry, I may have seeped into the aeather and given into my weakness of being a guy who has been overburdended. and For that I am sorry</h2></li>
